                                <p> <strong>After a breakup: 7 questions that will help you understand that you are ready for new acquaintances</strong><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Someone after a breakup needs a lot of time to recover and open up to new feelings. Someone easily jumps from one relationship to another, even if they don't after sorting out the mistakes. </span></p><p><span>Today we will talk about an interesting topic. When to start Dating and meeting after a breakup. We have translated and adapted an article by Professor Suzanne Degges-White (PhD) about 7 questions that you should ask yourself before starting Dating. </span></p><p><span>Perhaps after when you break up, you feel that you will never open your heart and soul to anyone else. The same feeling as after a bereavement of a loved one. Even if the relationship was far from ideal, it was still a part of your life. </span></p><p><span><b>Put the pieces of a broken relationship back together, but in a different way.</b></span></p><p><span>One of the most productive ways to bridge the gap - a process of reflection and reinterpretation. </span></p><p><span>When we can look objectively at what happened in the relationship, what was our role in its development and destruction, we actually heal ourselves. Instead of focusing only on the breakup of the relationship, think about the following, what was wrong, and personal development. It is important to learn from past relationships, give yourself time to think about everything and accept the new experience. </span></p><p><span>By thinking and analyzing, you will be less likely to become depressed.</span></p><p><span>If you take responsibility for the break-up and do it with compassion for yourself, you will be more likely to you will probably not make the same mistakes in the new Union, and you will be able to avoid parting.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>So, did you do the job? Have you learned from the past and are you ready to move on? </span></p><h2><span>First honestly answer yourself 7 questions:</span></h2><h3><span>1. Do I feel that ready for a new relationship? </span></h3><p><span>Do you want to meet a new partner because you are ready for a relationship? Or because friends, parents, and colleagues insist that you need a distraction? If you are ready, go ahead and start Dating. If it's just about friends, don't listen to anyone. There are no advisors here. What matters is what you want. </span></p><h3><span>2. How does my body feel physically when I think about Dating a new person? </span></h3><p><span>If you are nervous and excited about a new meeting, this is a good sign. You present a new scenario and don't dwell on what happened. Butterflies in your stomach indicate that you are attracted to a new acquaintance. </span></p><p><span>But if the thought of going out with someone makes you feel disgusting, it's probably not yet the time-or at least not the right person to spend the evening with.</span></p><h3><span>3. Will I be able to spend time with another person without having to compare them with my ex? </span></h3><p><span>If all you think about is the difference between a new acquaintance and an ex-partner, and you won't be able to see the new person for what they really are.</span></p><p><span>If the former partner was a terrible person, treated you badly, it is important to assess the character and behavior of potential partners, clearly understand whether they can be a threat or not, compared to the former.</span></p><p><span>But if you think that " the person is not as good-looking / not as smart / funny / hot / intelligent as the former, you are still holding on to the past without even fully realizing it. In this case, give yourself time to forget and let go, only then-start Acquaintances.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3><span>4. Can I take an objective look at my past relationships and take responsibility for the role I played to end them? </span></h3><p><span>If you're still looking back and can't figure out how and why the previous relationship worked if you fall apart, you won't be able to start a new relationship. You need to look objectively at who you are in relationships with others, as well as at how you behave in them, what mistakes you make.</span></p><h3><span>Ask yourself about the reasons why you are going to get acquainted again.</span></h3><p><span></span></p><h3><span>5. I want new acquaintances and meetings because I I wonder if I like this person, do I want to build a relationship, or just to make my former significant other jealous?</span></h3><p><span>If it's a matter of jealousy, it's definitely not yet time for you to get to know other people for your own purposes - not the best idea. First forget about your ex-partner, then look for him new.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3><span>6. If I was going with someone to meet to fill the void after a breakup?</span></h3><p><span>If you're trying to fill the void of losing your partner, you probably haven't done the job, let go, or analyzed the mistakes, and it's better to wait with your partner. acquaintances. </span></p><p><span>The void that you feel after a breakup is painful, but you need to learn to fill it yourself, without trying to " put another person in an empty place." </span></p><p><span>Not hurry. It is better to do something that you have always liked, and for which there was not enough time in the relationship. Communicate with friends, work and do what you love. But deal with the inner void, too. If necessary, contact a specialist.</span></p><h3><span>7. Last but not least, do I meet and go on a date because I need confirmation that I am still attractive and desirable? </span></h3><p><span>If you only get acquainted for confirmation of attractiveness and sexuality from someone, this is a worrying sign that you need to work on yourself. When you were in a couple, you could forget who you were before the relationship, and the feeling of self-love might have been destroyed by the relationship itself if it was difficult, or by the breakup if it wasn't what you wanted. </span></p><p><span>Before until will not be able to confirm its intrinsic value, it is not necessary to meet with other people in order to get external confirmation. Nothing good will come of such meetings. </span></p><p><span>People crave comfortable relationships that bring a sense of belonging and support. It is normal to want be in a couple, but make sure that you are forming a "couple" that you really want to be half of.</span></p><blockquote><span>Istochnik:  </span><span></span><a>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifetime-connections/201912/after-breakup-when-should-you-begin-dating-again</a><span> </span></blockquote><p><span>Are you ready for new acquaintances?
